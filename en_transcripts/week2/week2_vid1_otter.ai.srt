00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
Unknown: So, official Welcome to
open Life Science from my side

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,750
as well, very excited to have
you all on the call, I'll give

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,630
you a very quick overview of
what this program is about and

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,910
what you will be learning. So
you met Bernie's, and you and

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,350
me, we are the organizers of
this program. And we will always

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,440
have me in the call who will be
co hosting this with us. So as a

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,890
team, we believe that to be
effective, science should be

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,110
shared openly with others and
made freely available. And

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,080
you're here with us to do
similar amount of work that we

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,070
have planned for you. And we
have also done in our program.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,580
We're here to share what we have
learned and we hope that you

12
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,770
will find them useful. The open
Life Science program has been

13
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,100
designed to help early stage
researcher and potential

14
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,850
academic leaders to become open
sense ambassadors, maybe this is

15
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,700
a bit outdated, because we've
seen a lot more different

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,140
varieties of project coming to
the program. And a lot of you

17
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,140
are probably not academic or
early career researchers. So

18
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,070
please don't think that this is
very much limited to this

19
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,440
definition anymore. So again, we
think that science can advance

20
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,090
only we share our work with
other and not, NOT gate keep it

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,730
or compete for knowledge that
others can benefit from. But

22
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,400
often, researchers are very
skeptical about sharing their

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,790
work due to their fear of
getting scooped being criticized

24
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,070
or not knowing what they can or
cannot share. Because often, one

25
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,400
of the rewards that we have in
research is paper and a lot of

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,990
papers are tend to be novel. So
this novelty often reduces the

27
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,780
chances of people sharing work
from the beginning as they're

28
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:55,320
developing. In this program, we
will discuss how to work openly

29
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,830
without becoming scientific
vulnerable. What we would like

30
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,750
to do is to share information
around how you can own the work

31
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,660
that you've done, but at the
same time, be collaborative and

32
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,390
open your project for others to
come along and work with you.

33
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,730
And together, we will explore
the important concepts in open

34
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,750
science and apply them in our
work one step at a time. Our

35
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,200
cohort calls are organized every
second week, but you will have

36
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,290
one week breather period where
you will have a chance to apply

37
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,770
the topics that you'll learn
about, apply them in your work,

38
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,850
talk to your mentors, but also
have a chance to talk about

39
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:38,010
those in slack or on GitHub
issue tracker that we will share

40
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:45,060
towards the end of this call. So
this is something that is just a

41
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,630
reminder, because you all know
it's a 15 week long Mentorship

42
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,070
Program, which ends with one
week of graduation. With people

43
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,740
finishing and sharing about what
they have worked on you will be

44
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,340
attending cohort based training.
If you can't attend it, you will

45
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,690
be able to access all the notes
and videos on YouTube. And you

46
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,840
will be able to talk to us a
week later in an open office

47
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,350
hour to discuss any topic that
you didn't understand or some

48
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,980
clarification might be useful
for you. We will also give you

49
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,680
lots of assignments. And these
assignments are not to be

50
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,800
judged. So we want to look at
it, it's really up to you how

51
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,400
you take those assignments and
apply them into your work. So

52
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,270
it's a lot of reflective and
experiential learning for you.

53
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,630
If you are really, really
excited of what we are teaching

54
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,970
you there are a lot more
information out there. And one

55
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,360
of the things that open licenses
built upon is Mozilla open

56
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,960
leadership principle. And all
the materials are online under

57
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,320
CC by so if you feel that you
would like to learn a little bit

58
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,070
more, this is something that you
can always visit, we will also

59
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:55,920
add the link in the chat for
you. The idea of open leadership

60
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,730
is that everybody can become
open leader because open leaders

61
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,150
are people who design build and
empower their projects and

62
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,230
communities for understanding
sharing and participation and

63
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,950
inclusion. So, I would like to
show you this table and this

64
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,220
table is something you will see
quite a lot as we bring expert

65
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,850
speakers and they show you
different topics. So we go

66
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:22,380
through design, build empower,
and we build for the

67
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,890
understanding, sharing and
participation and inclusion. So

68
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,010
every time we are working and
developing certain aspects of

69
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,890
our project, we need to think
about am I designing it for

70
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,460
people to understand it? Am I
designing it that people can

71
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,060
share or build upon my work is
it actually participate true

72
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,410
inclusive. So this is a thought
process that we will go one by

73
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,050
one so you don't need to
remember it but this is a

74
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,230
principle that we hope you will
be able to integrate in

75
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,750
everything that you're doing
within open science.

76
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,140
Again, open science is a huge
umbrella term. It can have lots

77
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,610
of topic that you isn't just
restricted to open source

78
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,060
software or open access
publication. But there's a lot

79
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,210
more about open science that you
might be interested in. So as

80
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,080
you heard everybody have really
diverse ideas. Some of you might

81
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,770
want to share data openly, which
falls into the term open data,

82
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,930
you would like to share your
code, which is open source

83
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,380
software. Some of you have
hardware design, which is open

84
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,340
source hardware. Of course, you
know about papers and protocol,

85
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,390
which can be published in open
access. We also want to

86
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,000
encourage you to share your
results earlier, which is

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,070
preprint, sharing prep paper
reviews in open reviews. Many of

88
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,800
you are working on open
education and citizen science.

89
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,770
And we would like to bring you
all together so take the

90
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,050
opportunity to get to know each
other as well, because

91
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:51,870
scientific networking is also
part of open science. Open by

92
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,930
design is something we would
like you to remember because

93
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,890
open by default is not often
inclusive, or participatory or

94
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,130
community LED. But when we
design them into our project, we

95
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:05,280
can make sure that everything
that we are doing is actually

96
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,310
built for inclusion and
community. So one of the studies

97
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,750
in 2012, which had included
about 160, tech companies found

98
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,470
that the level of strategic
intent in openness and not just

99
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:25,710
openness alone correlates with
market performance. You can also

100
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,560
think about designing openness
into your work and it shouldn't

101
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,380
be a thoughtless default. This
is something that we want to be

102
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,310
extremely intentional about. And
I think that's what is in the

103
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:42,150
core of open Life Science
Program. You all are leaders,

104
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,880
and we believe that with your
leadership and your vision

105
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,460
combined with what we are
teaching in this program, you

106
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,710
can achieve a very positive
cultural change in your

107
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,830
community. And we hope you will
take the chance to exchange

108
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,720
those ideas and thoughts with
each other
